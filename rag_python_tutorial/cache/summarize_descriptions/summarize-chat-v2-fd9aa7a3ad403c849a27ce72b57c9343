{"result": "The entity consists of two separate Python libraries: \"Python 2D\" and \"Python 3D\". \n\n1. **Python 2D**: This is a 2D plotting library for Python, designed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It requires Python 3.6 or higher and is no longer actively developed.\n\n2. **Python 3D**: This is a 3D plotting library for Python, designed for creating 3D visualizations. It also requires Python 3.7 or higher and is no longer actively developed.\n\nBoth libraries are part of the Python ecosystem but serve different purposes, with \"Python 2D\" focusing on 2D plotting and \"Python 3D\" on 3D plotting.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
